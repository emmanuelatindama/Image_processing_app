To build an image processing web application using Python, follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the Project Scope
  -Identify the purpose: What specific image processing tasks will your app perform (e.g., image filtering, object detection, resizing)?
  -Target audience: Who will use your app, and what features will be most valuable to them?

Step 2: Choose the Technology Stack
  - Backend Framework: Use a Python-based framework like Flask or FastAPI for simplicity and flexibility.
  - Frontend Framework: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React or Vue.js) to create a user-friendly interface.
  - Database: Use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for storing data (if required).

Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment
  - Install Python and a virtual environment tool (e.g., venv or conda).
  - Install essential libraries:


Step 4: Build the Backend
  1. Set up the server:
	Create an API to handle image uploads and processing.
  2. Add endpoints: Include endpoints for different image processing functionalities.

Step 5: Create the Frontend
  - Use a framework or plain HTML to build a web page where users can upload images.
  - Use JavaScript (e.g., Axios or Fetch API) to send requests to your backend.

Step 6: Integrate Image Processing
  - Leverage libraries like OpenCV, PIL (Pillow), or scikit-image to implement advanced image processing techniques.

Step 7: Test and Debug
  - Use tools like Postman or Swagger to test API endpoints.
  - Debug both frontend and backend for seamless integration.

Step 8: Deploy Your Application
  - Deploy using platforms like:
	Heroku: Easy to use for small-scale apps.
	AWS/GCP/Azure: For scalable and robust solutions.
	Docker: To containerize your application.

Step 9: Add Features Iteratively
  - Examples: Batch processing, real-time processing, integration with ML models for tasks like object detection.
